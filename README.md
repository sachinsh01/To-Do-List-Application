# To-Do-List-Application
To-Do List Application can be used to maintain our daily tasks or list of tasks that we have to do. We can add tasks at any time and mark a task as done when completed. This project is able to perform the following operations:
1. Add a new task
2. Update details of an existing task
3. Deleting existing tasks
4. Mark a task as done when completed

In addition to these operations, this application has an easy-to-use interface. All the tasks are divided into the following sub-sections: all, pending, and completed, which helps to manage tasks based on their status of completion. Also, on the top-left corner of the web page, there is a digital clock that helps the user to keep track of time. The webpages are responsive as well which makes sure that the user gets a pleasant interface across all screen sizes.
